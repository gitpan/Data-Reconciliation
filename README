Reconciliation - Utility to compare tables & report differences

DESCRIPTION
     A reconciliation program is a program which tries to establish
     connection between two data sources. The variant currently
     implemented is actually a kind of diff which works on records and
     fields, instead of lines. The implementation expects Data::Table
     objects as sources.

     This is only an Alpha version. The INTERFACE WILL CHANGE to allow
     better reporting.
